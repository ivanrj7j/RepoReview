    "summary": "This repository implements Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN) for upscaling images, exploring depth data integration with MiDaS, loss functions, and network architectures. Aims to enhance image quality and explore GAN training strategies.",
    "evaluation": {
        "codeReadability": {"score": 75, "reason": "Clear structure in `generator.py` and `discriminator.py`. Comments explain key steps. Consistent naming conventions are used."},
        "codeQuality": {"score": 70, "reason": "Uses ResBlocks and DiscriminatorBlocks appropriately. The code avoids obvious anti-patterns."},
        "performance": {"score": 60, "reason": "Explores optimization through VGG loss and Adam. The algorithmic complexity isn't explicitly addressed."},
        "documentation": {"score": 65, "reason": "README provides a clear overview of goals and approaches. Inline comments explain some parts of the logic."},
        "testing": {"score": 20, "reason": "No explicit tests found. The project lacks dedicated unit or integration tests."},
        "collaborationEase": {"score": 60, "reason": "Clear project structure and some comments. Contribution guidelines are missing."},
        "modularity": {"score": 70, "reason": "Separates generator, discriminator, and blocks into different files promoting reusability."},
        "maintainability": {"score": 65, "reason": "Generally easy to understand. The code can be improved with additional comments."},
        "scalability": {"score": 50, "reason": "Scalability isn't explicitly addressed. The architecture's extensibility isn't clear."},
        "securityPractices": {"score": 40, "reason": "Security not explicitly addressed, no evidence of security-focused coding practices."},
        "creativity": {"score": 70, "reason": "Innovative approach by integrating depth data using MiDaS to improve super-resolution."}
